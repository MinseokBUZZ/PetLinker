# Project Proposal & UI Design

## Project Proposal ##

**Problem**: Animal shelters require an efficient method to manage pet profiles.

**Solution**: Develop an app specifically designed for shelter staff, enabling them to easily add, update, and delete pet profiles, including photos and detailed descriptions.

**Description**: The proposed app (called PetLinker) is a specialized tool tailored to meet the unique needs of animal shelters. It optimizes the management of pet profiles. The app provides a straightforward and efficient interface for shelter staff, allowing them to manage pet information with ease. Key features include the ability to swiftly add new pets to the database, update their information as needed, and remove profiles once pets are adopted. This digital approach not only conserves time and resources but also ensures that each animal is given proper visibility and a better chance at finding a forever home. The app's focus on shelter operations and staff usability makes it an indispensable tool for modern animal care and management.
